## How to calculate

### Basal metabolic rate
When calculating the basal metabolic rate, depending on gender, the factor 1 for men and 0.9 for women is multiplied by 24 and then multiplied by your own body weight.

### PAL-value
| Physical activity per day | PAL value |
|---|---|
| Frail, immobile, bedridden people (exclusively sedentary or lying down lifestyle) | 1.2- 1.3 |
| Office workers, precision mechanics (exclusively sedentary lifestyle with little or no strenuous leisure activity) | 1.4- 1.5 |
| laboratory workers, students, assembly line workers, teachers (sedentary work, at times also additional energy expenditure for walking and standing activities, little or no strenuous leisure activity) | 1.6- 1.7 |
| salespersons, waiters, mechanics, craftsmen (predominantly walking and standing work) | 1.8- 1.9 |
| construction workers, farmers, forest workers, miners, competitive athletes (physically strenuous occupational work or very active leisure activity) | 2.0- 2.4 |
